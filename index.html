            <h2>About Me</h2>

            <p>I was born in Nairobi City, Kenya. I have lived in Nairobi my whole life. My highest level of education is High School. I completed my O Levels last year and may go to university next year. I decided to attend Moringa because I have always admired the field of coding. I believe it's something I will definitely apply in my future career path. I read and watched documentaries about the creation of some famous apps and also how astronomers assemble rovers to go to space and use code to command them. I was inspired by how many strives and accomplishments humans have made in several sectors since the application of code and computer science in the 20th century.</p>
